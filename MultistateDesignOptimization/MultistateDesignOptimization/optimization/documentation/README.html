		<h1>Multistate Design Optimization</h1>
		<p>This is a set of classes for optimizing a multistate design model. This README file includes documentation of the classes, their fuctions, and input/output formatting.</p>
		<p>Numpy classes and functions are used in this implementation.</p>
		<p>Syntactically these classes are written for Python 3.5.</p>
		
		<h2><a name="Classes Overview">Classes Overview</a></h2>
		<p>Three main classes are included here: <code>Optimizer</code>, <code>SearchAlgorithm</code>, and <code>SimilarityMeasure</code>. <code>Optimizer</code> is a fully-fledged class, whereas the <code>SearchAlgorithm</code> and <code>SimilarityMeasure</code> are abstract classes designed to provide a unified interface for different functions.</p>
		<h4>Optimizer</h4>
		<p>
			<code>Optimizer</code> is the main outward-facing class. It integrates the search algorithm and the models to perform parameter optimization.
			This class handles file I/O and control of the search process and includes some housekeeping static functions.
			It stores a set of models, i.e. residues and their associated energies, as a set of numpy numeric arrays.
			The optimizer can work with both pre-averaged macrostate values, and also individual microstate values.
			To perform optimization, an instance of <code>Optimizer</code> needs an attached <code>SearchAlgorithm</code> object, which in turn needs an attached <code>SimilarityMeasure</code> object.
		</p>
		<h4>SearchAlgorithm</h4>
		<p>
			The <code>SearchAlgorithm</code> class is an interface/abstract superclass for implementations of search algorithms that look for the best set of hyperparameters.
			It has access to the set of models contained by an <code>Optimizer</code> object, which serves as the data pool, and its own set of models, upon/with which the search is performed.
		Each <code>SearchAlgorithm</code> classes requires an attached <code>SimilarityMeasure</code> object to determine fitness. </p>
		<p> <code>SearchAlgorithm</code> objects seek to maximize the similarity returned. </p>
		<p> <code>CuckooSearch</code>, an implementation of <code>SearchAlgrithm</code> is included. </p>
		<h4>SimilarityMeasure</h4>
		<p> <code>SimilarityMeasure</code> provides a an interface/abstract superclass for implementation of ways to compare two frequency distributions.
			It contains a reference/target distribution, against which experimental distributions can be compared.
		The return value is always on a range of [0, 1], where 0 is zero similarity and 1 is a a perfect match. </p>
		<p>
			Several implementations, the Jensen-Shannon distance, Kullback-Liebler divergence, and cosine similarity, are included.
		</p>
		<h4>Enumeration</h4>
		<p> <code>Enumeration</code> provides an emulation of enumerations found in C-based languages.
		In this context, they are specifically used to keep track of macrostate names and convert them to integers. </p>
		<h2><a name="Sample useage">Sample Usage</a></h2>
		<p> The following statements provide an example of running optimization over pre-average macrostate data.</p>
		<p><blockquote><code>
			# enumerations of macrostates and AA residues <br>
			MACROSTATES = enum("E-DHF-NADPH", "E-NADPH", "E-OPEN", "E-THF", "E-THF-NADPX", "TS"); <br>
			RESIDUES = enum('A', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G', 'H', 'I', 'K', 'L', 'M', 'N', 'P', 'Q', 'R', 'S', 'T', 'V', 'W', 'Y');<br>
			<br>
			# declaration of search space <br>
			ensembleSizes = numpy.array([20, 50]);<br>
			backrubTemps = numpy.array([0.3, 0.6, 0.9, 1.2, 1.5, 1.8]);<br>
			boltzmannTemps = numpy.array([0, -1, 1, 5.0]);<br>
			steepnessRange = numpy.array([0.5, 5]);<br>
			minWeights = numpy.array([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]);<br>
			maxWeights = numpy.array([1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1]);<br>
			<br>
			# initialize the Optimizer <br>
			optimizer = Optimizer(MACROSTATES);<br>
			optimizer.readTargetFrequencies("PATH_TO_TARGET_FREQS_FILE");	<br>
			optimizer.readData("PATH_TO_DATA_FILE");<br>
			<br>
			# initialize the SearchAlgorithm <br>
			search = CuckooSearch(optimizer.models, JensenShannonDistance(optimizer.targetFrequencies), False, 16, 1, 0.25);<br>
			search.setMaxIterations(iterations);<br>
			search.setParamBounds(ensembleSizes, backrubTemps, boltzmannTemps, steepnessRange, minWeights, maxWeights);<br>
			search.setAllSearchToTrue();<br>
			optimizer.useAlgorithm(search);<br>
			<br>
			# search and record best values <br>
			optimizer.optimize();<br>
			optimizer.writeFrequenciesToFASTA(optimizer.getBestFrequencies(), "path to output");<br>
			optimizer.writeBestParamsToText("path to output");
		</code></blockquote></p>
		<p>
			In the first two lines, we declare enumerations of the macrostate names and AA residue names.
			While not strictly necessary, these enumerations are useful for debugging and recordkeeping.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the second set of statements, the search space is declared.
			For values that are discrete, each value must be specified. For continuous values, a lower and upper bound are specified, in that order.
			The upper and lower bounds for the weights are two separate 1D arrays, with each index corresponding to the enumeration value of a macrostate.
			Note that all must be specified as numpy arrays.
		</p>
		<p>
			Next, an <code>Optimizer</code> is instantiated, and the target frequencies in a FASTA file are read in.
		The model data in form of a tab-delimited file is next read in. Other <code>readData()</code> functions exist for reading .dat files. </p>
		<p>
			A search object, in this case a Cuckoo search, is then instantiated with its associated similarity measure anonymously instantiated at the same time.
			The search space parameters are then given to the search object.
			The <code>SearchAlgorithm</code> class can search over all, some, or none of the values. Here, the <code>setAllSearchToTrue()</code> function is used to instruct the object to search over everything.
		The search object is then attached to the optimizer. </p>
		<p>
			Finally, the optimizer is used to start the search process.
			After completion, the residue frequencies corresponding to the best model is written to a FASTA file.
		The best parameters, along with the match value, and some data about the <code>SearchAlgorithm</code> and <code>SimilarityMeasure</code>, are writted to a text file. </p>
